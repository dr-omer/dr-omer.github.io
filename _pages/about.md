Welcome to my Research and Teaching website. I am currently working as an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences [(BMES-SMME)](http://www.nust.edu.pk/INSTITUTIONS/Schools/SMME/Departments/DBE/Faculty/Pages/Dr-Syed-Omer-Gilani.aspx) at the National University of Sciences and Technology [(NUST)](http://nust.edu.pk), Islamabad, Pakistan. I also have an appointment as the head of the IT department at SMME. I completed my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2013. Before this, I worked as a Research Engineer at Interactive Multimedia Lab, Singapore (2006-2008) and Intelligent Transportation Research Group Sweden (2004-2006).

I have been active in academic research since 2004. My research interests include computer vision, medical signal and image analysis, machine learning, computer graphics, control systems, and power electronics.

I am a senior member of IEEE (USA), IET (UK), and IMechE (UK). I regularly review manuscripts for IEEE Access, Journal of Biomedical Signal and Control and chair technical tracks at international conferences (RTCES'17, ICIP'18, ICGCET'18, APICEE'19, ICR'19).
