Human visual system can quickly, effortlessly, and efficiently process visual information from their surroundings. As a result, modern computer vision has been heavily influenced by how biological visual systems encode properties of the natural environment Human subjects can perform several complex tasks such as object localization, identification, and recognition in scenes, owing to their ability to “attend” to selected portions of their visual fields while ignoring other information. Although visual attention can either be driven by bottom-up / exogenous-control or top-down / endogenous-control mechanisms, research studies have found that bottom-up influences act more rapidly than top-down processes. Our work here focuses on

Running psychophysical experiments to understand governing mechanisms of attention
Proposing computational models for these mechanisms
Applying these models in real-world scenarios
